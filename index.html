            <p>This is a meal that people eat at lunchtime, around noon.The vegetarian-friendly chowder pairs perfectly with a vibrant green salad or a thick slice of crusty bread. It is loaded with a handful of vegetables to give you a wonderfully chunky bite with each spoonful. The smoked paprika adds a subtle smokiness that enhances the kick from the jalapeño and cayenne peppers.</p>
